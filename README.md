# recursive-regex-matching
This repository contains code to
search for regular expression 
matches recursively in all files
within a directory and all 
sub-directories

# regex_matching.py
This module contains code to
perform the recursive search,
plot the output, and create
a test directory to 
perform stochastic testing

# unit_test_regex_matching.py
This code performs a set of unit tests on
the regex-matching.py module to make sure
the code performs correctly.

By creating a directory system with
different sub-directories and files
and matching a set of regular expressions
to those files, one can compare
the output of a recursive search
for regular expression matches
to the output of the creation
search of the regular expressions.
